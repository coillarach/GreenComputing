    "Python is the most popular language for many resource-intensive activities such as machine learning and data science. Because the datasets used in those areas are so large, processing takes a lot of time and a lot of resources. Being able to measure execution time is the first step on the way to identifying bottlenecks and making improvements.\n",

    "* `setup` is where import statements and other initialisation code can be defined. These statements are not included in the timing\n",
    "* `number` is the number of times that `stmt` should be run. The result is divided by the same number to give the average time for a single execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code creates a list of 10000 random integers using the [`random`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) package. It runs 10000 times and displays the average time for one execution in seconds. "
